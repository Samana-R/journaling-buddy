<p> Today, the world is so fast-moving, that the importance of emotional well-being cannot be overstated. Journaling is a centuries-old practice that has given many the ability to introspect, reduce stress, and process emotions. Still, many find it hard to journal consistently or lack motivation to get deep into their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>This buddy project is aimed to address the gap by providing a safe, supportive, and interactive platform that encourages an individual to articulate his feelings and thoughts in a peaceful and controlled manner. This, by leveraging the power of technology, will look into developing a virtual companion with potential toward creating self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and mental resilience.</p>
